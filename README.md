# Router
This is a C++ implementation of a Steiner-tree router that can connect pins for a single-layer chip. Given a set of pins for a single net, the Steiner-tree router routes all pins within a chip. The pins are connected by horizontal lines (H-line) and/or vertical lines (V-line). Steiner points are introduced during routing.
